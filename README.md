# button-ripple-

I'm Kelvin, I'm learning web development. At this present moment I'm 8 months into my of self-taught software engineering.

In this particular project I embedded comments within the CSS. When applying overflow hidden to the button within CSS I had some difficulties. 

I found the solution to my issues here
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3970455/how-to-make-the-overflow-css-property-work-with-hidden-as-value

I learned To hide an absolute positioned element, the container position must be anything except for static. It can be relative or fixed in addition to absolute.

Hopefully this tip will be helpful to others. 

Although this is a hobby, I'd like to be employed for my passion eventually.
